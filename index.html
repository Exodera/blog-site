			<p class = "body-header-sub">By Oratile Ditlhage, 24 January 2022</p>
			<p>So You've been to the gym lately and looked at yourself in the mirror but you can tell that the military tank top and shorts you have on are really not cutting it.
			</p>

			<br>
			<p>These products have been hand-picked by yours truly, for you based on a couple of attributes. Only the top five were chosen as they were the most import and these consist of: </p>
			<ul style = "padding: 20px">

			<h2>1.Headphones</h2>
			<p>Lets be real here for moment, if you're working out alone, you need these. There is nothing more depressing than gym music and if you're lucky, your gym might be able to take your song requests but if you're like miost of us out here listening to the bad ball room music they play then you need to throw a pair of these bad boys on your head and get yourself to hype-central.</p>

			<h2>2.Smart Watch</h2>
			<p>It's a new and I know most you will be hitting the gym to shave off the couple of pounds those Christmas meals brought along with them. The smart watch is just incredible of losing weight is your goal because you can actually see how much calories you are burning on the go. This will allow you to write down your stats and attempt to beat your own record when you go for your next sweat-sesh!</p>
			
			<h2>3.Gym gloves</h2>
			<p>You know this would not be a list without a pair of gym gloves. Every gym-rat needs a pair of these, hec even women need them too but if your trying to get hard hands like hulk the feel free to bench two 40KGs with your bare hands.</p>
			
			<h2>4.Wrist Wraps</h2>
			<p>These don't help too much with your lift but boy do they look good. They are small and subtle but easily make you look like the beast your are and on top of that they offer moderate support to your wrist when you're pushing that heavy weight</p>

			<h2>5.Water Bottle</h2>
			<p>I know this is pretty obvious but I've seen countless people come to the gym for the first time and they forget to bring a bottle which results in numerous trips to the water fountain throughout the session. Make sure your bottle can handle at least 1 litre of water otherwise you'll also be joining the water-fountain travelers.</p>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<p>Going to the gym is hard work but looking good isn't. Having good attire can really boost your confidence and make you push your limits as long as you're not overdoing it to the point where assessories wear you down. Now that you've got the look, go out and hustle that body.</p>
